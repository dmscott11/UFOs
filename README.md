## Overview
Given a file of data in javascript, Dana wished to create a webpage and dynamic table to filter out the data. The purpose of this final step was to create a filterable table (country, city, shape) in addition to date to allow for a more accessible webpage. 
## Results
We were able to create a function within our app.js file that allowed for the filtering of a variety of different fields by creating a new table and appending or removing rows that were added. We iterated through all of the data in the data.js file and made it so that this webpage was more useful and user friendly.

## Summary
The webpage itself works as desired by Dana. One drawback of the design is that it doesn't allow for partial searches. Another would be that there isn't a list populated of the available options. 
### Two Recommendations
- I would recommend further building out the html and javascript elements to provide a drop down list once the box is selected. This would further increase the usability of the webpage.
- Secondly, I would recommend a feature to sort by state. Someone using the portal may not care as much about searching by city as they do by state.
